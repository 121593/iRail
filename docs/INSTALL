INSTALL 

o	rename _htaccess to .htacces
o	ln -s HAFAS hafas	 (on Linux/Unix webservers, NMBS isn't very consistent with its capital usage)
o	make sure you have PECL-HTTP (dev-php5/pecl-http) installed for PHP
o	htaccess only works on Apache. If someone can make rewrite rules for nginx ? 

Should be it
