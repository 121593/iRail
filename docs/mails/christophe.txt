I just made some tests with some stations and I have results for all of them. I have no negative feedback yet, so all seem good!

The only problem is the speed. With the URL way, all was done in maybe 2 seconds max and now it can take 10sec, that's why I really need a server.

I have a friend from France that open-sourced his train application and all the PHP scripts.

As I have no php knowledge, I cannot help, but maybe you will find some intresting stuff there.
