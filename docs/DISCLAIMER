DISCLAIMER.

As read on multiple sites, including http://blog.tuinslak.org/2010/06/stopping-irail-be/ the NMBS / SNCB forbids the use of this website/webapp as of 12th June 2010.
I have complied the the NMBS / SNCB request to stop the website for a little while until my lawyer replied.

As you can clearly see, this is a very simple data scraping website, stripping off all layout, and inserting my own. Nothing fancy. At all. 

This is open sourced due to popular demand.

I strongly discourage hosting this website anywhere. The NMBS / SNCB might sue you. Use the official website (NMBS) instead.

I am NOT responsible if this website, or a part of this website, is actually accessible through a browser on any other domain than irail.be. I am only showing you HOW I did it. 

See LICENSE for additional information.
