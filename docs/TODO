Urgent:

o	Fix stations such as Mechelen and Mechelen-NEKKERSPOEL
		=> NMBS shows intermediate page >> can no longer use "$stationName [B]"; [B] gives errors now
			=> see http://yeri.be/cc + see errorStations.txt

Normal:
 
o	clean up css and put it in .css file
o	get list of international stations for international.php
o	python sitemap generator is broken, find other one (?)
o	align center or something, check effect on iPad.
o	make sure to not get sued :(
o	veranda font for people with bad eye sight
o	use cURL instead of http_post
o	get decent icons -.-

Keep in mind, work in progress. Website was never completely finished (and hard to do without an API)
